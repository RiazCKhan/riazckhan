### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I believe the User is at the heart of Technology. The goal is to provide the best User experience. As a Jr. Full Stack Web Developer what I enjoy most about Web Development is the ability to establish connections, identify feedback loops, and implement concrete solutions. As a transitioning Counsellor, Web Development enables me to support and enrich communities across the globe.
